I have experience building database driven web applications from front-end to back-end. My education, experience and passions make me a great candidate for the Software Engineer position at Codazen.\r\nI began my current sprint in life by teaching myself Java and C# in order to solve a problem at work that involved rewriting antiquated software. Though I left the company before completing the project, I turned it into a passion project that utilizes the D3.js library. I further developed my coding skills while attending Dev Bootcamp where I created various web apps on teams using object oriented Ruby and JavaScript while implementing Agile methodologies. I am skilled in front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, React and jQuery as well as back-end frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. I have the ability and drive to quickly learn and implement new technologies as they are needed. These are all skills that I would bring to your team.\r\nI'm confident that I would fit in perfectly with your team and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and interests further. Please feel free to contact me anytime. Hope to talk with you soon!\r\nKind Regards,\r\nEric Booker\r\n415-374-4012\r\nericbooker12@gmail.com\r\nLinkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-booker-29232350 GitHub: https://github.com/ericbooker12"}, "commit"=>"Update Job", "id"=>"1"}

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (JobsController#resume is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

I have experience building database driven web applications from front-end to back-end. My education, experience and passions make me a great candidate for the Software Engineer position at Codazen.\r\nI began my current sprint in life by teaching myself Java and C# in order to solve a problem at work that involved rewriting antiquated software. Though I left the company before completing the project, I turned it into a passion project that utilizes the D3.js library. I further developed my coding skills while attending Dev Bootcamp where I created various web apps on teams using object oriented Ruby and JavaScript while implementing Agile methodologies. I am skilled in front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, React and jQuery as well as back-end frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. I have the ability and drive to quickly learn and implement new technologies as they are needed. These are all skills that I would bring to your team.\r\nI'm confident that I would fit in perfectly with your team and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and interests further. Please feel free to contact me anytime. Hope to talk with you soon!\r\nKind Regards,\r\nEric Booker\r\n415-374-4012\r\nericbooker12@gmail.com\r\nLinkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-booker-29232350 GitHub: https://github.com/ericbooker12\r\nSOFTWARE ENGINEER/MAKER\r\n "}, "commit"=>"Update Job", "id"=>"1"}
